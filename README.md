# RSA crap
this tool generates RSA keys that can then be used to encode or decode messages.
RSA keys will likely not work with other RSA decryption methods because i am bad at converting strings to integers for encoding. run the requirements bat or something idrk

IF U HAVE A BETTER WAY OF ENCODING MESSAGES TO INTEGERS PLS LET ME KNOW
